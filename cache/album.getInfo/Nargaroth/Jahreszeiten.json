      "content": "Jahreszeiten (\"Seasons\") is the sixth full-length release of the black metal band Nargaroth. The songs on the album don't deal with the divisions of the year, as specified by Ash:\n\n[The songs] are dealing with the seasons of love, known to nearly everybody of us. The love for an other person, which in the beginning blossoms like the spring to fully unfold in the summer, until, with the time passing, the autumn casts the first shadows and doubts, which can turn into hatred and contempt in the winter.\n\nOn the vinyl version of the album, each song contains a spoken introduction. These monologues, along with the prologue are fragments from Wagner's 1996 book, \"Between the Stones\".\nThe album contains the following dedication:\nDedicated to the memory of Dr. H.-J. Koraus (18.02.1946 ~ 23.11.2007) and to Dr. M. Wernado, who inspired and escorted me on my way during the last five years, in many peaceless moments in the experiences of a man and his self-despise, and without whose help I would have never found to myself again. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nargaroth/Jahreszeiten\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
