Quiet 8\n5. The Bitterness\n6. The Doorstep\n7. Where we will not meet us\n\n\n1. Let it happen\n\n\n...and a clamor.\nFor those who hopelessly fail, the trusted have broken their strength...\nThis city to them was hell and Mecca.\nAnd for those who have sold their lives in the numbness of their lives to the hearts of the people...\nSlaveless!\n\n\nBottoms up\nFor whores, dogs, convicts...\nWhat they fertilize death so they still need life;\nBottoms up\nTo children - graves\nSo that the cold, knowing the earth, would not desire heaven;\n\n\nBottoms up\nFor tomorrow's unknown, for the days spilled;\nBottoms up\nFor black lungs, Evviva l'arte!\n\n\nIn this cold... let it happen.\nTonight... let it happen.\nAt the bottom... let it happen.\n\n\nBored so much, you can't be more bored.\nWe're practicing hard sleep...\nTo not bow down to the mornings and to fall in love at night\nIt's like each one of them is the last one\n...and in the bar, ashes of ashes to fill the head...\nSeptember's euphoria and falls lurk\nStaggering on the pinnacles of disaster\nAnd trust and believe that November will guess all of us...\n\n\nIn this cold... let it happen!\nOn this night... let it happen!\nAt the bottom... let it happen! T\nfor the voice of our ridiculous generation!\n\n\n2. The Great Misogynist\n\n\nDon't be afraid, whore.\nThis night is already being born.\nDon't be afraid of the booze.\nThis one never deceives.\nThimble in thimble\nChalices like bells\nAnd whores and whores!\nAnd ravens and crows and crows!\n\n\nDon't be afraid, whore.\nMorning's coming up.\nHit the booze with every fallen man at the cross\nRace against the night, the frost and hope\nChange to the little ones who sow in tears...\nOrnaments of pure monotony\nYou're bored with boredom - the one that's just as clean\nHit the thread of guilt not forgetting the crosses.\nAnd scream with all your might: the streets, the streets, the streets!\n\n\nRusty dawn\nEstrogen's sewn dreams.\nBitter rum\nSticky stomach - Monotony\nBig deal.\nWet whip\nLaughter for fear\nLime, sand - Monotony\n\n\nDon't be afraid, whore.\nThis night is already being born.\nDon't be afraid of the booze.\nThis one never deceives.\nOrnaments of pure monotony\nYou're bored with boredom - the one that's just as clean\nHit the thread of guilt not forgetting the crosses.\nAnd scream with all your might: the streets, the streets, the streets, the streets!\n\n\n3.  Esperal woven\n\n\n   Cellar spiral of impressions\n   The one who's afraid of the mornings\n   And taproom... drunken mouth.\n   And taproom... a bruised muzzle.\n\n\n   He was looking for disaster in its slabs:\n   Ashes of defeat,\n   Dream ashtray.\n   He found it... the blackest of all the black bread!\n\n\n   \"I have found the will of a slavishly pale...\n   Without a job, with a woman and a child at the station.\"\n\n\n   Faded sky\n   Deserted housing estates\n   Some people say that night is coming\n   The autumn one.\n\n\n   Go into the depths!\n   There's a night there!\n   Like a black spades!\n   There's daytime!\n   Esperalem woven!\n   I see the night!\n   I see the day! It's as black as night!\n\n\n   There - I found her... the blackest of the black bread;\n   There - slavishly pale will;\n   A lover of empty tears;\n   slavishly pale\n   They called her boring;\n   The morning one....\n   ...and evening in case of the morning\n   ...and autumn in case of... winter.\n\n\n   There - I found it... the blackest of all the black bread;\n   There, slavishly pale will;\n   A lover of empty tears;\n   Without will I prefer pale;\n   She will be called with water;\n   The morning one....\n   ...and evening in case of an accident.\n   morning.\n   ...and autumn in case of... winter.\n\n   I dream of the Queen of Spades and I dream of ash.\n\n\n5. The Bitterness\n\nBetween the autumn supper and the winter death, the words of the Poles wander around.\nThere were and there will be no words like a stone, no relentless hearts.\nAs he was, so will the Chochol!\nThe content is a ruin for the form that I was supposed to be an executioner for you....\nDisorder and stagnation against the background of ruby time indications\nSamogon of the sick years!\n\nSo booze!\nBooze!\nBooze again!\nAnd the skunkie... will break my mind, let it go out!\nWe suppressed the sense, went out into the night, spat at the laws of the world with contempt,\nToday, we pay homage to them in the graves to the neck with every dirty breath.\nBooze, then!\nBooze!\nBooze again!\nAnd the skunkie... let them crumble their minds!\n\nDead I'm alive...\nTo rise up, to be reborn...\nBut how can you believe in tomorrow...?\nWithout today.\n\n6. The Doorstep\n\nShe once came into a blizzard at night.\nThe crunch of snow under her shoes sounded like music.\nHe's been stranded by fear.\nShe is as old as winter.\n\n\"For seven years in this swamp, and the end is not seen.\"\nTwo shadows dance by candlelight - confession in the chamber and black has the power of a confessor.\n\nThis is it! The grave, the chamber, and nobody there.\nThat's him! A corpse, a cigarette and coffee, and she...\n\nAbhorrence!\nThe abhorrence comes for more\nThe abhorrence still requires more!\n\nAnd the day has become a mystery again\nAnd though spring will come with the melt...\nThough fears will dispel\n(?)\nI still hate you all.\n\n\n7.  Where we won't meet us\n\n\nWhere we won't meet us.\nNot from \"ashes\" today, but from \"will\" tomorrow.\nWhere we won't meet us.\nThe night does not end with the night, but the day begins with the day\nWhere we won't meet us.\nMelancholy doesn't eat us.\nWhere we won't meet us.\nFrom the cobblestones, the desire grew and the city was scattered. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Odraza/Esperalem+Tkane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
