It contained 2 tracks (+ intro and outro) of a weird mixture of both black and deathlike metal including a lot of experimental synthparts. The tracks however, were perhaps a little \"over the top experimental\", and the sound was awful. So, they decided not to release it. They didn`t even bother to mix it. Today, not more than perhaps 50 copies are left of this promo. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Enslaved/Nema\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
