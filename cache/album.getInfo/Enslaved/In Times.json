      "content": "In Times marks a further move by black metal band Enslaved to a more progressive sound following similar trends on their last few albums. Some reviewers see Herbrand Larsen as responsible for this change, with Exclaim! stating that \"the secret star of the record may be keyboardist Herbrand Larsen, whose role in the band has expanded markedly over the past few albums and really comes to the fore on In Times\". Loudwire agree, writing in their review that \"with each passing album, keyboardist Herbrand Larsen has become a more integral part of the band utilizing his soothing clean vocals to contrast and compliment Grutle’s uncompromising rasp\". Ivar Bjørnson of the band told Blabbermouth in an interview that In Times \" is the most consistent body of work we have so far: it incorporates our 'blacker' past with our influences from prog rock, our present sense of absolute freedom, and the joy of being in this band\".\n\nThe album was recorded in Bergen, Norway, and was mixed in Sweden by Jens Bogren at his Fascination Street Studios.[3] An article in Terrorizer explains that \"some of the album’s weirder textures and sounds were conducted deep in the woods of Valevåg, south of Bergen, in a mobile studio adding that \"you can definitely hear the earthy, organic feel this has given the album\".\n\nIn Times was released in numerous formats, including digital download, a digipak CD and different coloured vinyl limited editions.\n\nThe liner notes for the album include a note that reads \"All Hello Kitty-ride playing dedicated to Fenriz\". This is in reference to a comment Fenriz made in regard to a ride cymbal pattern often used by Enslaved.\n\nThe album charted in some territories in its first week of release, including Norway and Finland. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Enslaved/In+Times\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
