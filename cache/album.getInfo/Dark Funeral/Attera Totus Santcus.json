It  was recorded and mixed at Dug Out Studios, and produced by Daniel Bergstrand and Örjan Örnkloo.\n\nThis album also marked the cessation of vocalist Emperor Magus Caligula's role as a bassist for Dark Funeral - both studio and live.\n\nThe title was chosen to convey the band's vehement anti-Right-Hand Path stance. The Latin title of the album actually contains a grammatical error. \"Totus Sanctus\" alone would seem to refer to either a single \"holy man\" or a single \"holy\" object which is associated with the male grammatical gender. Being the direct object of the imperative verb \"Attera\", \"Totus Sanctus\" would be more correctly rendered \"Totum Sanctum\".\n\nIn addition, the song Atrum Regina would more appropriately be titled \"Atra Regina\", since \"Regina\" is a feminine singular noun. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dark+Funeral/Attera+Totus+Santcus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
