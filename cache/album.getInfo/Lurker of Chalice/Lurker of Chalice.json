White Spheres - 16:40 (note that approximately the last 10:25 of this track consists of silence; the actual song runs for about 6:16)\n\nThe track listing names eleven songs, but only ten tracks are included on the CD-R. It is assumed that songs 8 and 9 were combined as track 8. \"In the Court of the Crimson King Diamond\" is a pun on the title of the English progressive rock band King Crimson's d√©but album In the Court of the Crimson King and the stage name of the Danish heavy meta singer King Diamond. \"Unconscious Years of Mare Crisium Clavius\" is named after two craters on the Moon, the first of which is Latin for \"Sea of Crises\" and the second of which is named after a Jesuit astronomer.\n\nThe 2005 album has been released in various configurations. The most complete is a 2015 CD reissue with the following track listing:\n\n1. Untitled - 2:09 (this is a shortened new arrangement of \"White Spheres\")\n2. Piercing Where They Might - 6:13 (this is a completely different arrangement than the one on the demo)\n3. Spectre as Valkerie Is - 6:43\n4. Minions - 9:33\n5. Paramnesia - 4:09\n6. This Blood Falls as Mortal Part III - 10:47\n7. The Glory Experiment - 8:26 (only included on the 2008 and 2015 CD versions)\n8. Granite - 5:28\n9. Vortex Chalice - 6:34\n10. Fastened to the Five Points - 8:32\n11. Wail - 5:06 (only included on the vinyl and 2015 CD versions) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lurker+of+Chalice/Lurker+of+Chalice\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
