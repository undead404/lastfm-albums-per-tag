      "content": "Thornography is the seventh full-length studio album by Cradle of Filth released through Roadrunner Records in October, 2006. The album is produced by Anthrax guitarist Rob Caggiano, engineered and co-produced by Dan Turner and mixed by Andy Sneap, and once again features narration by Doug Bradley (as with Midian and Nymphetamine).\n\nDani Filth explained the album's title thus: \"This title represents mankind's obsession with sin and self. The thorn combines images of that which troubled Christ, the Crown of Thorns, thus intimating man's seeming desire to hurt God and also, of the protecting thorn and the need to enclose a secret place or the soul from attack. An addiction to self-punishment or something equally poisonous. A mania. Twisted desires. Barbed dreams. A fetish. An obsession with cruelty. Savage nature. Paganism over Christianity. The title can also represent a sexual attraction to religious iconography as in the case of the 'possessed' Loudun nuns. I like the title because to me it invokes images of a darker, sexier pre-Raphaelite scene wherein Sleeping Beauty's castle is won and she is awoken by a poisonous kiss. A darker, more adult fairytale.\"\n\nPaul Allender told Terrorizer magazine, \"There are quite a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, but this is the first time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so involved in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there are quite a lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.\" \n\nIn news posted on the official Cradle of Filth website in mid May 2006, it was revealed that the planned artwork for Thornography had been vetoed by Roadrunner Records. A replacement was soon forthcoming (see box), although numerous CD booklets had already been printed with the original image. Dani Filth stated in an interview with Metal Hammer that the controversy was over the nakedness of the female figure's legs on the original cover: \"When we put the original next to the new version, it was so slightly changed... The nymph's skirt was a little longer. It was like a game of spot the difference\". Charles Hedger told Gothtronic.com that the new cover \"is practically the same... A lot of Americans are really religious and Roadrunner were basically saying that Wal-Mart was not going to take Cradle albums with that on the cover. But Wal-Mart never takes Cradle albums anyhow, so it doesn’t make any difference.\"\n\nThree cover versions were recorded during the album's sessions, namely Samhain's \"Hallowe'en 2\", Shakespears Sister's \"Stay\", and Heaven 17's \"Temptation\". \"Hallowe'en 2\" (renamed \"HW2\") was released on the Underworld: Evolution soundtrack. It is included as a bonus track on the Japanese release of the album. \"Temptation\" is part of Thornography's finalised track listing, and features vocals by Dirty Harry. Harry also stars in the promo video for the track, which was released a week before the album as a digital single. \"Stay\" surfaced in early 2008 on the Harder, Darker, Faster re-release (see below). Press releases by both Liv Kristine and Cradle themselves announced that \"Stay\" would be Kristine's second guest vocal spot with the band (following \"Nymphetamine\"). Adrian Erlandsson later confirmed however that the duet never actually took place, although versions were recorded with both Harry and Sarah Jezebel Deva. The latter is the version included on the re-release.\n\nEarly reports during the album's production process mentioned a track called \"The Flora of Nightfall, The Fauna of War\". It is unknown which track this was the working title for, although the words appear as a lyric in \"Cemetery and Sundown\".\n\nThe album was leaked to p2p and torrent internet sources a month before its official release date.\n\nThornography debuted at #66 on the Billboard Top 200 chart selling nearly 13,000 copies <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cradle+of+Filth/Thornography\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
