      "content": "Blood in Our Wells (Ukrainian Кров у наших криницях, Krov u Nashykh Krynytsyakh) is the fourth album by the Ukrainian black metal band Drudkh, originally released on March 23, 2006, through Supernal Music. As with all of Drudkh’s releases on Supernal, it was later remastered and reissued with new artwork on Season of Mist’s Underground Activists label, due to issues with royalty payments from Supernal. Like its predecessor, it features lyrics taken from classical Ukrainian poetry, and the sound is more influenced by folk music and progressive rock this time around, with most compositions comprising of two or more interlocking movements. It has often been cited as their strongest record to date.\n\nAs with The Swan Road, lyrics are taken from classical Ukrainian literature. The lyrics to \"Furrows of Gods\" are adapted from a poem by Lina Kostenko; the lyrics to \"When the Flame Turns to Ashes\" are adapted from a poem by Oleksandr Oles'; the lyrics to \"Solitude\" are once again taken from the work of Taras Shevchenko; and the lyrics to \"Eternity\" are lifted verbatim from the work of Yuriy Klen. Several tracks also sample the film Mamaj, and for this reason Blood in Our Wells has been described as \"more cinematic\" than its predecessors.\n\nBlood in our Wells was released in two non-vinyl formats: normal jewel case (unlimited and available everywhere), and super jewel case plus (limited to 1000 hand-numbered copies and made available only through Supernal Music). \n\nMastering issues mean that there is a sharp cut-off on frequencies above 16 kHz on all CD issues of the album. These issues are less severe on vinyl editions due to harmonic resonance.\n\n   1. Навь [Nav'] (2:25)\n   2. Борозни Богів [Furrows of Gods] (8:57)\n   3. Коли Пломінь Перетворюється на Попіл [When the Flame Turns to Ashes] (10:37)\n   4. Самітність [Solitude] (12:24)\n   5. Вічність [Eternity] (10:38)\n   6. Українська Повстанська Армія (Ukrainian Insurgent Army) (5:02)\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drudkh/Blood+in+Our+Wells\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
