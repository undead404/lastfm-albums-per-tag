      "content": "The Swan Road (Ukrainian Лебединий Шлях, Lebedynyy Shlyakh) is the third album by the Ukrainian black metal band Drudkh, originally released on March 13th, 2005 through Supernal Music. As with all of Drudkh's Supernal releases, it was later remastered and reissued with new artwork through Season of Mist's Underground Activists label, due to issues with royalty payments from Supernal.\n\nIt is characterized by shorter songs and more prominent lyrics than are found on previous Drudkh releases; the lyrics are all taken from the works of Ukrainian nationalist poet Taras Shevchenko. This album contains an increased use of distortion in the mix and more frequent usage of blast beats, but the last three tracks are considerably more low-key for Drudkh, with the final track being a folk ballad, presaging the direction they would pursue farther on the following year's Songs of Grief and Solitude.\n\nMastering issues mean that there is a sharp cut-off of frequencies above 16 kHz on CD editions of the album. Due to harmonic resonance, these issues are less severe on vinyl editions. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drudkh/%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9+%D1%88%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%85\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
