      "content": "\"Si monumentum requires, circumspice\" is an album by the black metal band Deathspell Omega, released in 2004. The album title (stylized as \"SI MONVMENTVM REQVIRES, CIRCVMSPICE\") is Latin for \"if you seek his monument, look around you\", from the epitaph of Christopher Wren's tomb at St Paul's Cathedral.\nMusically, it represents a massive departure in sound from the band's previous work, both for the increase in recording quality and for the pursuit of far more avant-garde and experimental directions than the band's previous work. The album is also intentionally structured in the manner of 1970s double albums, with each LP side opening with a \"prayer\" (side four, which opens with \"Carnal Malefactor\", being an arguable exception).\n\nThe track \"Malign Paradigm\" is a tribute to the Swedish black metal band Malign, and their track \"Ashes and Bloodstench\". \"Drink the Devil's Blood\" is a re-recording of a song of the same title appearing on the band's first album, Infernal Battles. The re-interpretation of this station contains completely new lyrics dealing with a Eucharistic theme, in keeping with the more cerebral lyrical approach of this and subsequent releases.\n\n\"Si monumentum requires, circumspice\" (the title is written both with u's and v's in the packaging of various editions that have been released) is the first entry in a metaphysical trilogy the band released dealing with the relationship between God, Satan, and man. The second and third entries are \"Fas â€“ Ite, maledicti, in ignem aeternum\" (2007) and \"Paracletus\" (2010). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deathspell+Omega/Si+Monvmentvm+Reqvires,+Circvmspice\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
