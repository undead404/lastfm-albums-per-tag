      "content": "'Fas – ite, maledicti, in ignem aeternum' (Latin for \"Divine Law – Go, Accursed, into Everlasting Fire\") is a 2007 album by the black metal band Deathspell Omega. The album takes its title from the Vulgate translation of Matthew 25:41 (part of the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats), \"discedite a me maledicti in ignem æternum\", usually quoted as \"ite maledicti in ignem aeternum\". The album was released as a digipak with a 20-page booklet on July 16, 2007 and in the United States on July 17, 2007 through The Ajna Offensive. Ajna has licensed the CD version for the U.S., with Southern Lord Records assisting the distribution and importing a substantial amount of vinyl copies.\n\nMany of the lyrics are taken from works by George Bataille, a frequent source of lyrical inspiration for Deathspell Omega. For instance, the first and last lines of each song (except the \"Obombration\"s) are taken from My Mother, while the line \"Every human being not going to the extreme limit is the servant or the enemy of man\" in \"A Chore for the Lost\" comes from Inner Experience. Overall, the works known to be quoted are My Mother, Inner Experience, Theory of Religion, and The Solar Anus. At least half of the song titles are also taken from his works: \"The Shrine of Mad Laughter\" from My Mother, and \"Bread of Bitterness\" and \"A Chore for the Lost\" from Inner Experience.\n\nA lengthy list of annotations for the album can be found at the /r/DeathspellOmega wiki. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deathspell+Omega/FAS+-+Ite,+Maledicti,+in+ignem+Aeternum\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
