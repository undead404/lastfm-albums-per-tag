It continues the avant-garde and progressive direction they had been exploring on 2004's Si monumentum requires, circumspice, and is considered by the band as something of an \"appendix\" to that album.\n\nThe title Kénôse is French for Kenosis, a theological term.\n\nThe track titles have been labelled in different ways across various releases. The track names I, II, III are the most commonly used, but some vinyl pressings (such as the band's untitled 2012 box set) use:\n\n1. \"Everything, except GOD, has in it some measure of privation, thus all individuals may be graded according to the degree to which they are infected with mere potentiality.\"\n2. \"Therefore, GOD honours the sword so highly that He calls it His own ordinance, and will not have men say or imagine that they have invented it or instituted it.\"\n3. \"The stillness of Contemplation is allowed in billions of woeful cries, so astonishingly simultaneous and in unison, each and every second, they defuse each other in such a perfect manner, equalling the most inscrutable of all silences.\"\n\nThe second set is listed on at least some CD pressings (including the 2005 U.S. pressing) as an alternate set of titles for the songs (e.g., track one is labelled: I. \"Everything, except GOD, has in it some measure of privation, thus all individuals may be graded according to the degree to which they are infected with mere potentiality.\")\n\nDespite being labelled as an EP, at over thirty-six minutes in length Kénôse is longer than many full-length albums. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deathspell+Omega/K%C3%A9n%C3%B4se\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
