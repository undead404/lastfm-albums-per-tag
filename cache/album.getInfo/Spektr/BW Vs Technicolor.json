      "content": "SPEkTR have an unconventional approach to song writing. The eclectic sound universe stems from the wide ranging musical backgrounds of the band members. The music is created with an emphasis on atmosphere rather than genre. The band manages to enforce a strong and solid unity despite the diverse expression. \nSPEkTR formed in Copenhagen in 2000 and consist of Manoj Ramdas,formerly Raveonettes, (guitar), Henrik Madsen (bass) Cem Avus (drums), Karsten Garner (percussion) and Ole J. Storli (keys). In addition to this SPEkTR use a soprano choir both at their live shows and in the recording studio.\n\nSELLING POINTS\nSPEkTR inhabit a sonic landscape ranging from creaky rock to dusty soundtracks and pompous vocal arrangements. The music sounds like the soundtrack of a life found on the other side of black and white TV screens; one minute you’re lying on the beach shaded by palm trees, the next minute you’re being chased through gloomy city streets.\nWhat you discover is a world of dreamy themes and razor sharp riffs. \n\nREVIEW:\n“What SPEkTR are composing, is something that uses elements of rock, surf, electronics and vocal-stylings, so that it’s rock music. But not the characteristic rock’n’roll that people associate with film-soundtracks today, it’s actually an older school....but with a futurist ambition”\n•\tDavid Fricke, Rolling Stone magazine <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Spektr/BW+Vs+Technicolor\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
