      "content": "Sequenzen einer Wanderung (roughly, Sequences for a Journey) is the seventh full-length album by the German progressive black metal band Nocte Obducta, released in 2008. Despite the album's release date it was recorded in 2006; it was pushed back due to issues with the record label and producer, and in fact the band was on hiatus in 2008. Additionally, the album is atypical of the band's style, containing almost none of the black metal touches for which the band is known and instead consisting mostly of progressive metal and ambient material. The album consists entirely of two tracks, which are alternately referred to as either \"Teil 1\" and \"Teil 2\" (\"Part 1\" and \"Part 2\"), as below, or as \"Ende\" and \"Nebel II\" (\"End\" and \"Fog II\"), for the first movements of each piece. The tracks are divided into the following movements:\n\nTeil 1:\nI. Ende (0:00-0:06)\nII. Über wind'ge Wiesen (0:06-2:45)\nIII. Oktober (2:45-5:02)\nIV. Wald/Route: Erde - Uranos (5:02-8:39)\nV. Ein Abend im Dezember (8:39-9:50)\nVI. Zu fernen Ufern (9:50-12:56)\nVII. Herbstlaub (12:56-13:32)\nVIII. Im Sonnensturm (13:32-14:35)\nIX. Nebel - I (14:35-15:13)\nX. Wanderung/Für Syd (15:13-18:02)\nXI. Der Nussbaum (18:02-21:28)\nXII. Allein (21:28-end)\n\nTeil 2:\nXIII. Nebel - II (0:00-4:29)\nXIV. Kind der kalten Nebel (4:29-7:30)\nXV. Es bersten Brücken hinter mir (7:30-9:40)\nXVI. Januar/Vorbei an Ruinen/Spuren im grauen Schnee (9:40-13:36)\nXVII. Desîhra (Reprise Zu fernen Ufern) (13:36-14:27)\nXVIII. Bei den Feuern (14:27-16:39)\nXIX. Die schwindende Glut (16:39-18:12)\nXX. Welch finstere Kaschemme (18:12-18:38)\nXXI. Im Dunkel (18:38-end)\n\n“Syd” refers to Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd. The album was dedicated to Barrett and to Rick Wright, also of Pink Floyd; both passed away during the production of the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nocte+Obducta/Sequenzen+einer+Wanderung\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
