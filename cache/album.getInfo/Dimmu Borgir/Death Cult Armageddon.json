      "content": "Death Cult Armageddon is the sixth studio album by Norwegian black metal band Dimmu Borgir. A video for one of the album's singles, \"Progenies of the Great Apocalypse\" was made. Singles for this and the song \"Vredesbyrd\" (sung entirely in Norwegian) were released. Parts of the album were recorded with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nThe artwork within the album displays what appears to be an industrial factory, inside of which the band members are living out their fantasies, some of which are similar to scenes seen in the music video for Progenies of the Great Apocalypse. Artwork was done by Swiss artist Joachim Luetke. Most of the songs have a common apocalyptic theme.\n\nAbbath of the band Immortal did guest vocals on \"Progenies of the Great Apocalypse\" and \"Heavenly Perverse.\"\n\nThe songs \"Progenies of the Great Apocalypse\" and \"Eradication Instincts Defined\" were used as background music for the trailer of the movie Hellboy (film). \"Eradication Instincts Defined\" is also featured in the Stardust 2007 movie trailer. \"Progenies of the Great Apocalypse\" was also used in the TV show Battle for Ozzfest, in which the band was featured as the band for whom a radio arrangement had to be made.\n\nA DVD/audio version of the album was also released, as well as an Ozzfest edition with a second disc featuring extra tracks, a video of \"Progenies of the Great Apocalypse\" and promotional pictures for the album.\n\nThe album is notable for being the first album released by Nuclear Blast Records to sell over 100,000 copies in the U.S. by 2006. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dimmu+Borgir/Death+Cult+Armageddon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
