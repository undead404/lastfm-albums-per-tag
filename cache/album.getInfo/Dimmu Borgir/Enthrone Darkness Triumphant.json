It has been put out in many formats including a limited edition vinyl (300 white & 1000 black) and in 2002 a deluxe CD version was released with bonus material.\n\nIt was also the group's first album to display the newer logo (the old \"black metal\"-styled logo is still seen on the back cover artwork of the original pressing).\n\nDue to the success the album has seen, many felt the band \"sold out\" by signing to Nuclear Blast and for dramatically changing their style. According to A.N.U.S. the album \"is a ripoff of bands that were new when these musicians were born.\" However, many praised the differing approach Dimmu would undertake, having the guitar riffs inspired by classic metal bands and having heavier symphonic elements and an over-all darker feel.\n\nmore compilation albums:\n\nDimmu Borgir - The Dimmu Best Borgir (CD1) (2002):\nhttp://t.0uu0.ru/t/PLA099/c/V/b/T.jpg\n\n\n01 Det Nye Riket\n02 For All Tid\n03 Raabjorn Speiler Draughems Scodde\n03 Den Glemte Saanhets Hersker\n04 Alt Lys Svunnet Hen\n05 Devi's Path\n06 Broadeskapets Ring\n07 Nar Sjeler Hetens Til Helvete\n08 Sorgens Kammer\n09 Mourning Palace\n10 Spellbound\n11 In Death's Embrace\n12 Entrance\n13 A Succubus In Rapture\n\nThe Dimmu Best Borgir (CD2) (2003):\n\nhttp://t.0uu0.ru/t/PLA099/c/V/b/S.jpg\n\n01 Moonchild Domain\n02 Chaos Without Prophecy\n03 Metal Heart (cover of Accept)\n04 Dreamside Dominions\n05 The Promised Future Aeons\n06 Grotesquery Conceiled\n07 Arcane Lifeforce Mysteria\n08 Fear And Wonder\n09 Kings Of Carnival Creation\n10 Hybrid Stigmata The Apostasy\n11 Sympozium\n12 Perfection Or Vanity <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dimmu+Borgir/Enthrone+Darkness+Triumphant\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
