The album also has two new studio tracks, \"Sorgens kammer – Del II\" and \"Avmaktslave\". The album included a bonus DVD with five live songs performed at Ozzfest 2004 and the American version included a free cloth patch.\n\nThe instrumental \"Sorgens kammer\" from the original album could not be rerecorded due to copyright issues associated with the 1992 Amiga game Agony, as then-keyboardist Stian Aarstad had passed the song off as his own.[citation needed] Similarly, the intro to \"Alt lys er svunnet hen\" had been plagiarized from the song \"Sacred Hour\" by Magnum and was also left off the rerecording. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dimmu+Borgir/Stormbl%C3%A5st+MMV\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
