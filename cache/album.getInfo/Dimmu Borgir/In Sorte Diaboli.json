      "content": "In Sorte Diaboli (incorrect Latin for \"In Direct Contact With Satan\"; the Latin literally means, \"in the lot of the Devil\" or \"in the chance/fate/destiny of the Devil\") is the seventh studio album by Norwegian black metal band Dimmu Borgir, and is the band's first concept album. A site on the Nuclear Blast website was created for In Sorte Diaboli, in which a new promotional photo can be seen and an audio sample can be heard.\n\nIn Sorte Diaboli is the band's first concept album, with a story located in medieval Europe. It is about a priest who begins to doubt his faith, and then ends up taking the place of the Antichrist. \"There's this dude that works as a priest's assistant, and after a while he just discovers that he has nothing to do with Christianity,\" Silenoz says. \"He just sort of has this awakening and realizes that he has different abilities and different powers and is leaning more to the dark side.\" The conclusion of the story in the booklet implies that the story of In Sorte Diaboli is not yet finished, possibly hinting that Dimmu Borgir's next studio album will continue this concept. Additionally, the \"Making of In Sorte Diaboli\" Special feature, Silenoz says that the concept of this album will continue into the next two albums, finishing a three part series. IGN named the album the Top Metal Album of 2007.\n\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number 43 on the Billboard 200, selling about 14,000 copies in its first week. In their native Norway, the album peaked at number 1, the first time a black metal band has ever done that anywhere in the world. It also marks the first time a Norwegian act has cracked the Billboard 200 since A-Ha. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dimmu+Borgir/In+Sorte+Diaboli\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
