The correct track listing is:\n1. Part I - Sary Oy - 11:10\n2. Part II - Jashil Oy - 10:48\n3. Part III - Kyzil Oy - 25:28\n\nOr, alternatively:\n1. Sary Oy - 11:10\n2. Jashil Oy - 10:48\n3. Kyzil Oy - 25:28\n\nNote that some sources spell the third track's title as Kysil Oy. It is possible that some releases of the album have used this alternate spelling, but the back of the CD box spells it as Kyzil Oy (seen here). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Darkestrah/Sary+Oy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
