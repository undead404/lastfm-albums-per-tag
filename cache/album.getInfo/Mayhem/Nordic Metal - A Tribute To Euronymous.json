The bands featured on this release come together for a reason that they don't expect all to understand. Each one of them had their own special relationship with Euronymous and were proud to be a part of this monumental tribute. They are all excellent at what they do. They are the new kings, the creators, the originators of their new breeds of 'Nordic Metal'. My dark Hails to them all...\n- Paul 'Typhon' Thind\nNecropolis Records\n\n\nTrack 12 misspelled as \"Rodt Og Svart\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mayhem/Nordic+Metal+-+A+Tribute+To+Euronymous\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
