      "content": "Ordo Ad Chao is the fourth full-length album by the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. \"Ordo ad chao\" is incorrect Latin (correct: \"Ordo ad chaos\"). It is meant to be translated as \"order to chaos\" - a reversal of the Latin expression \"ordo ab chao\" (\"order from chaos\") often cited as the motto used in Freemasonry. The album received the Spellemann award for best metal album on 2 February 2008. It is the first Mayhem album to feature vocalist Attila Csihar since the 1994 release, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. Jan Axel Blomberg (Hellhammer) stated on his official forum that the drum tracks were not equalized and only the bass drums were triggered. He finished saying \"the production sounds necro as fuck, but that's the way we wanted it – this time. It represents Mayhem today.\" And indeed, the sound of the album is far rawer than that of any official Mayhem studio release since Deathcrush, with a very bass-heavy mix. Despite that, the album continues the somewhat unorthodox songwriting approach showcased on the band's last two releases, with \"Illuminate Eliminate\" being the band's second longest song ever. The album features some death grunts and clean vocals. The album was released to the world on April 23, 2007 and to North America a day later. The album charted at #12 in Norway, making it the band's highest charting album yet. There is a limited edition version of the album that comes in a metal case that is limited to a production of 3000. As stated by Blasphemer in an interview with Inferno Magazine, Necrobutcher did not play the bass guitar on the album, despite being credited in the booklet.\n\nLine - Up\n\n    * Attila Csihar - Vocals\n    * Blasphemer (Rune Erickson) - Guitar, Bass\n    * Hellhammer (Jan Axel Blomberg) - Drums\n    * Note: Necrobutcher (Jørn Stubberud) did not perform Bass on this album\n\nTrivia\n\nAll lyrics by Attilla except Track 8, by Atilla & Blasphemer\n\nAll music by Blasphemer.\n\nStandard jewel case version, as well as a metal slipcase edition in a red jewel\ncase, and a jewel case with red CD, are available. All three feature enhanced\nmaterial, which is a whole album in \"mp3\" format in one file. There are two\nempty folders, which were not meant to be on the CD - they are just a part of\nthe \"Enhanced CD\" format standard. Metal slipcase version is limited to 3000\ncopies.\n\n12\" gatefold LP released by Season Of Mist limited to 1000 orange LP, 500 marble\nLP, both with poster.\n\nAlso available official heavy-vinyl Picture LP version made by Dark Side Records\n(Greece) under license of Season of Mist. Limited edition of 1000 handnumbered\ncopies housed in clear plastic sleeve including A2 poster and lyric sheet.\n\nThere also exists a special version, limited to only 13 pieces. This version is\nplated on 24 KT gold and put in 18 x 24 inch frame. All copies were given to the\nband members. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mayhem/Ordo+Ad+Chao\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
