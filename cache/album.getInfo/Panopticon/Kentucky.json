A portion of the profits from this record are being donated to \"Kentuckians for the Commonwealth\" to fight mountaintop removal.\n\nThis album features a much more bluegrass-oriented sound than most of Panopticon's previous material; while ...Speaking...(Collapsed Version) on Panopticon's It's Later Than You Think split with Wheels Within Wheels was a bluegrass version of a track from Panopticon, and there was a bluegrass section on the Collapse track The Death of Baldr and the Coming War, this album features only three metal compositions, with the rest being bluegrass or ambient. The album is based around the history of Austin Lunn's adoptive home state Kentucky, focusing particularly on the labour and environmental issues surrounding coal mining. Three tracks are covers of old folk or bluegrass songs. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Panopticon/Kentucky\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
