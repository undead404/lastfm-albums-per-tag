      "content": "Opus Nocturne is the third studio album by Swedish black metal band Marduk. It was recorded and mixed at Hellspawn Studios in September 1994 and released that December by Osmose Productions. It was re-released in digipak format that included bonus rehearsal tracks on June 27, 2006. Opus Nocturne is the last Marduk album to feature Joakim Göthberg on vocals and Dan Swanö as mixer. Opus nocturne was the first album to showcase Marduk's signature hyper-speed blast beat tempo on their later albums, however Opus Nocturne was different in that it still contained much of the melody from Those of the Unlight while retaining this break-neck speed, instead of sheer brutality on albums like Heaven Shall Burn... When We Are Gathered and Nightwing.\n\n\"Materialized in Stone\" was originally the title for the track \"From the Dark Past\" that appears on Mayhem's \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", the title was changed by Per Yngve Ohlin before his death. Marduk later adopted the title for the song on this album. They had prevously also used a song title by Per Yngve Ohlin on their \"Those of the Unlight\" album. This probably being a vague tribute to Per and his works.\n\nLine - Up\n\n# Joakim Göthberg – vocals\n# Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson – guitar\n# B. War – bass\n# Fredrik Andersson – drums\n\nTrivia\n\nLyrics for the track \"Opus Nocturne\" were written and performed by It Särkkä.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Marduk/Opus+Nocturne\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
