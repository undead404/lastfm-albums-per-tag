      "content": "Panzer Division Marduk is the sixth studio album by Swedish black metal band Marduk. It was recorded and mixed at The Abyss in January 1999 and released in June 1999 by Osmose Productions. The theme of the album is war, as Nightwing was blood, and La Grande Danse Macabre (the band's next studio album) would be death, forming a trilogy of \"Blood, War and Death,\" Marduk's vision of what black metal is. Panzer Division Marduk was the last Marduk release by Osmose Productions.\n\nThe album cover features a photo of a Swedish tank used in World War II, not a German one. The internal sleeve has picture with a tank column triumphant across a city in ruin: this is the Red Army across a destroyed Berlin in 1945.\n\nThe concept of World War II in literally every track initially led many proponents of National Socialist black metal to consider the band akin to them, notwithstanding the fact that vocalist Legion and guitarist/composer Morgan publicly debunked this rumor, saying that Marduk has no political point in their lyrics, and the band has nothing to do with Nazi views. Panzer Division Marduk earned a lot of backlash from National Socialist black metal bands, mainly Ukraine's Nokturnal Mortum (vocalist and guitarist Knjaz Varggoth stated once in reference to Marduk that he'd like to \"rip apart those Jew fuckers\" for disgracing Nazi ideology.\n\nLine - Up\n\n# Legion – vocals\n# Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson – guitar\n# B. War – bass\n# Fredrik Andersson – drums\n\nTrivia\n\nAlso released as a digipack with the Marduk shield emblem stuck on the actual\ncover.\nSome versions contain EP \"Fuck Me Jesus\" and 2 Bathory cover's \"Woman Of Dark\nDesires\" and \"In Conspiracy With Satan\" from the Bathory's tribute.\n\nRereleased in 2008 (12th of February) with new artwork and three bonus tracks:\n9. Deathride\n10. Todeskessel Kurland\n11. Panzer Division Marduk (Fan Made Video)\n\nRe-released version shows the German heavy tank Pzkpfw VI \"Tiger\" during the\nKursk panzer battle in July 1943. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Marduk/Panzer+Division+Marduk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
