      "content": "Deafheaven's highly anticipated fourth album, Ordinary Corrupt Human Love, is available now. The band’s second full-length for Anti-, Ordinary Corrupt Human Love follows 2015’s critically acclaimed New Bermuda.\n\nWorking again with producer Jack Shirley, Deafheaven have expanded their heavy, kinetic sound to bring in layered psychedelic vocals, jazz-inspired percussion, and intricate piano melodies. Ordinary Corrupt Human Love takes its title from Graham Greene’s The End of the Affair, reflecting a theme of hazy, yearning romanticism threaded throughout the album.\n\nOrdinary Corrupt Human Love’s lead single “Honeycomb” further reveals Deafheaven’s literary sensibilities. With its lyrics referencing Argentinian writer Julio Cortázar (author of the stream-of-consciousness novel Hopscotch), the endlessly captivating track is accompanied by a video that shows glimpses of Deafheaven in the studio and captures their wanderings around San Francisco.\n\nreleased July 13, 2018 \n\nRecorded live to tape at 25th street recording \nIn Oakland, CA in February 2018 \nProduced, engineered, mixed, and mastered \nBy Jack Shirley \n\nOn Ordinary Corrupt Human Love, \nDeafheaven is George Clarke – Kerry McCoy – Daniel Tracy – Shiv Mehra – Chris Johnson \n\nManagement – Cathy Pellow, Sargent House \n\nArt Direction and design – Nick Steinhardt \nPhotography – Sean Stout \n\nAll music and lyrics written and produced \nBy Deafheaven \n\nAdditional vocals and production on “night people” \nBy Chelsea Wolfe and Ben Chisholm \n\nSpoken word on “you without end” read \nBy Nadia Kury, taken from excerpts of the short \nStory “black and borax” by Tom McElravey <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deafheaven/Ordinary+Corrupt+Human+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
