The pink and orange colors on the cover are meant to resemble the color seen on the inside of one's eyelids when laying in the sun. The inspiration to have the title Sunbather written out in a simple, block formation was drawn from Pulp's 2001 album We Love Life. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deafheaven/Sunbather\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
