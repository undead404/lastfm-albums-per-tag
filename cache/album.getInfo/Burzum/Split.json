The first 3 tracks have totally awful sound for the demo '91 but the other 4 Burzum tracks have pretty good sound and the unreleased version of \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\" is really good! ...Onto the Gorgoroth part....this is a demo is a very raw and harsh sounding demo and it contains live tracks. If you really like Gorgoroth and have never been able to find this demo on anyone's trade lists etc...this CD is for you. The track listing for Gorgoroth is 8. Gathered at Blakulla (intro) / Sexual Bloodgargling 9. (Under) the Pagan Megalith (Gorgoroth \"Live in Germany\") 10. Katharinas Vortgang 11. Crushing the Scepter (Regaining a Lost Dominion) 12. Ritual 13. Maancskuggens Slave ...Total running time for the CD is 69:33  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Burzum/Split\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
