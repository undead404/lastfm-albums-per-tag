      "content": "Filosofem (Norwegian for Philosopheme) is the fifth release by the Norwegian black metal artist Burzum. It was recorded in March 1993 and was the last recording before Varg Vikernes' imprisonment. However, the album was not released until January 1996.\n\nAccording to Burzum's website, the Norwegian version is the \"definitive\" version, as it uses both the original song titles and lyrics.\n\n1. \"Burzum\" (Darkness - in the Black Speech of Mordor) – 7:05\n2. \"Jesu død\" (Jesus' Death) – 8:39\n3. \"Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament\" – 7:53\n4. \"Decrepitude I\" – 7:53\n5. \"Rundtgåing av den transcendentale egenhetens støtte\" (Tour Around the Transcendental Pillar of Singularity) – 25:11\n6. \"Decrepitude II\" – 7:53\n\nThe album received relatively major success for a black metal album at the time. It entered the independent music charts in the United Kingdom and also received very positive reviews in European and Norwegian magazines.\n\nThe opening song was the first Vikernes wrote as Burzum. It had been previously recorded in September 1992 for the Hvis lyset tar oss album, but Vikernes was dissatisfied with it and re-recorded it for this album six months later.\n\nThe album is recorded under purposefully bad conditions. No guitar amplifier is used, Varg plugged his guitar into his brother's stereo with a 1/4\" plug and used an old fuzz pedal. He had asked a sound technician for the worst microphone he possessed and Varg used the microphone on a headset.\n\nThe album cover and booklet contain artwork by Theodor Kittelsen. The front cover is titled \"Op under Fjeldet toner en Lur\" (Norwegian for \"Up in the Hills a Clarion Call rings out\").\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Burzum/Filosofem\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
