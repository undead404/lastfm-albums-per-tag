The line-up at that time, especially the guitar player and Satyr, wanted to play purer Black Metal so it was natural that Satyr took over the creative leadership as he was the one with the strongest bonds to Black Metal. This was the demo that helped shape Satyricon - and it also got us our first record contract. Due to popular demand the demo has sold a lot of copies, but because of the hassle we had printing and selling these cassettes we stopped making them. The demand for it was still there, even years after we started releasing albums. We really wanted to make it available for those who desperately wanted it so Satyr contacted Enslaved and asked them if they were interested in releasing their brilliant demo ”Yggdrassill” on a split CD with Satyricon. Both of us put an exclusive track on it and to this day the request for this split CD is considerable. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Satyricon/The+Forest+Is+My+Throne\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
