      "content": "Volcano\n2002, Capitol, EatURmusic/Colombia Records 2004\nI like it if an album title enriches the listening experience with the proper associations. \n’Volcano’ does this as well as ’Rebel Extravaganca’, Satyricon’s last album that gave back savage fury to the extreme metal scene. This music is unpredictable like the forces of nature, sometimes eruptive and seething with primordial might, sometimes slowly but unstoppable like lava. ’Volcano’ offers a stark contrast to ’Rebel’. \nThe straightforward song structures highlight the grim atmosphere of black metal. \nTheir exceptional skills as musicians are solely dedicated to this use. While ’Rebel’ operated with elements of surprise, ’Volcano’ aims at capturing the listener, at sucking him into a maelstrom of fiery emotions. In spite of the brutal display of power Satyricon manage to add subtle nuances: dynamic changes in tempo, shifting sound shades add a sharp, organic naturalness to the menacing gloom – thus giving it relevance, because this darkness is no romantic invention, no abstract delusion, but derived from firsthand experience. The sound of ’Volcano’ is the sound of the cozy cocoon of civilization torn apart, it envisions the cold emptiness behind. \nThis album strengthens Satyricon’s role as the guilty conscience for a musical genre that carries unscrupulousness on its banners but turned it into a holy idol a long time ago, thus strangling all innovation. ’Volcano’ doesn’t preach revolution, it is an astute confession to the fundamental truths of artistic existence. It doesn’t work with clichees, instead it approaches the abyss inside every human being with a shocking directness: Hate, despair, anger and fear. By its sound ’Volcano’ is undoubtedly metal, but its uncompromising spirit puts it in line with all the works of art that don’t want to satisfy whatever they see as the need of the consumer, but express the inner self of the artist. This is genuine art, as I fell it is more worthwhile to encounter you personal demons in a stranger’s work than to be befuddled by anonymous and insubstantial illusions of happiness. In this sense ’Volcano’ is certainly no pop music, but without any doubt something that deserves popularity, if only for its sincerity. \n\nRobert Müller \nMetal Hammer Germany <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Satyricon/Volcano\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
