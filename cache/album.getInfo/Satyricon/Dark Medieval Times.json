Unlike a lot of other bands we hadn’t spent five years underground releasing demos and 7 inches. We released a couple of demos before the debut - they sold really well – but we didn’t do it so much to promote the band, or to ”get down with the scene”. It was more a case of showing people what we were capable of and finding someone who would be interested in releasing records with us. We had a lot of international connections and pen pals throughout the underground but it wasn’t important to us to be accepted or be a part of it. Maybe that’s how we won respect! We just did what we believed in, not caring about what others were doing. “Dark Medieval Times” was different from everything else out there at the time. Sure, there were elements, and inspiration, from traditional Black Metal - and there should be, too, with our backgrounds. The difference was the extensive use of medieval atmosphere, and the incorporation of acoustic guitar and flute. The mood of Theodor Kittelsen’s drawings were a great inspiration and so the booklet features his drawing ”Pesta Drager”. Listening to the album now there are sounds that we’d change but it was a debut album, we can hear the unique Satyricon direction that we were developing at the time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Satyricon/Dark+Medieval+Times\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
