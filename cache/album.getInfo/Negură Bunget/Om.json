      "content": "Om is the fourth full-length album by the Romanian black metal band Negură Bunget, originally released on October 27, 2006, by Code666 Records. It is a concept album based around a creation myth; the album title translates as Human. The album has been re-released in various configurations throughout the years, including a vinyl version through Enucleation Records that features the bonus track \"Văzduh\" (\"Air\"), a Chinese version through AreaDeath Records that features two of the songs from the band's EP Inarborat kosmos, and a second, vinyl edition through Blood Music that does not feature any bonus tracks but has been remastered for the first time. The original release of the album also came with a DVD, which has not been included with many of the reissues.\n\nThe song titles translate from Romanian as follows:\n\n1. Dark Times\n2. Weaver of Lights\n3. The First Human\n4. Silent Knowledge\n5. Arboreal\n6. The Underneath\n7. Of the Clouds\n8. Of Stone\n9. The Final Dream\n10. Sun's Round Dance\n11. The Second Human\n\nThis is the final full-length recording of original material by the band's Hupogrammos - Sol Faur - Negru lineup; this lineup also recorded 2010's Măiestrit (a re-recorded version of the band's second album Măiastru sfetnic) and Focul viu (a live album recorded in 2008, but not released until 2011) before the departure of Hupogrammos and Sol Faur. These two formed Dordeduh while Negru continued Negură Bunget with a succession of new lineups until his death in 2017.\n\nCritical and fan reception of Om has been consistently high since its release, and it is a cornerstone of the band's legacy as well as one of the most influential black metal records of the 2000s; it has had a substantial impact on the post-rock/black metal fusions of the ensuing years, and has also become one of the defining fusions of European folk music and black metal. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Negur%C4%83+Bunget/Om\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
