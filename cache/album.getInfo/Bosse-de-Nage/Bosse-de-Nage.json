The band's sound on this album is somewhat rawer than it is on their later material.\n\nThe band has not officially released lyrics for this album, but the lyrics for the two \"Marie\" songs are based on passages from Georges Bataille's The Dead Man; the two \"Excerpt from Paris Spleen\" songs are based on passages from Charles Baudelaire's poem of the same name; and \"Excerpt from the 5th Canto\" is based on a passage from the Comte de Lautr√©amont's Les Chants de Maldoror (tr. Alexis Lykiard). The remaining two songs have original lyrics, but the band has no plans to release them, as vocalist Bryan Manning is dissatisfied with their quality. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bosse-de-Nage/Bosse-de-Nage\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
