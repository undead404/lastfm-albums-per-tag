It consists of two dungeon synth songs: \"Arcenstone\", that was originally written for the darkwave project of Silenius called \"Mirkwood\" (which was never released), and \"Saruman\", a song left over from the \"Dol Guldur\" sessions in 1996.\nThe songs are not in high quality and just taken from the original tape were they have been recorded.
