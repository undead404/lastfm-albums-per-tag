      "content": "\"A Quick Fix of Melancholy\" is the fourth studio EP by Norwegian avant-garde band Ulver, released in 2003.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n\"Little Blue Bird\" – 6:35 \n\"Doom Sticks\" – 4:40 \n\"Vowels\" – 6:18 \n\"Eitttlane\" – 5:22 \n\n\"Eitttlane\" is essentially a remix of \"Nattleite\" (from Kveldssanger); the names are anagrams of each other. The lyrics to the song \"Vowels\" are taken from a lipogram poem with the same name by Christian Bök, a Canadian experimental poet. \n\nUlver (Norwegian for “wolves”) is a multi-disciplinary musical trio from Norway. Since their first, folklore-influenced black metal release in 1993, Ulver’s musical style has been fluid and increasingly eclectic, blending genres from avant-garde rock and trip hop through symphonic and chamber traditions, right to noise and experimental music, with heavy reliance on electronic and ambient techniques.\nKristoffer Rygg (September 9, 1976), also known as Garm, Trickster G. and recently also God Head is a Norwegian-Grammy nominated [1] vocalist, musician and producer widely known in the underground metal community for his multi-range singing styles in black metal, experimental music, ambient, electronics, film music, et cetera.\n\nBorn in Oslo, Rygg was 16 years old when he formed Ulver, which was considered one of the more experimental bands of the black metal genre as well as an instigator for related subcategories such as folk metal and avant-garde metal.\n\nIn addition, Rygg had also been a vocalist for Borknagar (1995-1997) and Arcturus (1993-2003), both of which comprise many eminent musicians from the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was also the one responsible for introducing Borknagar to the singer who replaced him, ICS Vortex, when he parted ways with the band.\n\nMost recently Rygg has also been working with concrete/jazz/improvisational project Æthenor, involving notable musicians such as Daniel O'Sullivan of Guapo, Stephen O'Malley of Sunn O))) and David Tibet of Current 93. In April 2008 he played five concerts with Æthenor in Europe. It was his first time on stage in over a decade.\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ulver/A+Quick+Fix+of+Melancholy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
