      "content": "Under a Funeral Moon is the third album by the Norwegian black metal band, Darkthrone. It was released in July 1993, and marked Darkthrone's complete musical conversion to the black metal style. This album also contained the band’s first Norwegian song. \n\nDarkthrone's previous album, A Blaze in the Northern Sky, retained some death metal traits. However, in an interview, Fenriz claimed that they began recording Under a Funeral Moon with the intention of creating a \"pure black metal album.\" For this purpose, the studio production was toned-down to achieve an atmosphere that was more \"cold\" and \"grim\". Fenriz regards the album and its recording as the foundation for Darkthrone's later work.\n\nUnder a Funeral Moon is the last album on which guitarist Zephyrous (Ivar Enger) performs, as he left the band shortly after its release. The person who appears on the cover artwork is vocalist Nocturno Culto.\n\nThe album was remastered and reissued by Peaceville in 2003, as well as being repackaged in a cardboard digipak. In addition to CD, this album was released by Back on Black in the form of a limited edition (2000 copies) picture disc LP. The third chapter of a four-part video interview (spanning the first four albums) between Fenriz and Nocturno Culto was also included as bonus material. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Darkthrone/Under+a+Funeral+Moon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
