      "content": "A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the second album by the Norwegian black metal band, Darkthrone. It was released in February 1992 and contains the band's first black metal recordings.\n\nDue to Darkthrone's sudden change from death metal to black metal, Peaceville Records was reluctant to release the album in its original form. The band then threatened to release it through Deathlike Silence Productions, the record label owned by Øystein \"Euronymous\" Aarseth. However, Peaceville eventually agreed to release the album as it was recorded. In an interview, Fenriz said that the album was somewhat \"rushed\" as half of the songs feature \"death metal guitar riffs\" simply played in a \"black metal style\".\n\nBassist Dag Nilsen left the band before the recording of the album, but agreed to play session bass. This is the last recording featuring Dag Nilsen on bass guitar. The person who appears on the front cover is Ivar Enger (Zephyrous), the band's rhythm guitarist.\n\nThe album was remastered and reissued by Peaceville in 2003, as well as being repackaged in a cardboard digipak. The second chapter of a four-part video interview (spanning the first four albums) between Fenriz and Nocturno Culto was also included as bonus material.\n\nAll the releases of A Blaze in the Northern Sky have a note saying \"This album is eternally dedicated to the king of death/black metal Euronymous.\"\n\nLine-up:\nNocturno Culto - Vocals, Lead Guitar\nZephyrous - Rhythm Guitar\nDag Nilsen - Bass Guitar (Session)\nFenriz - Drums <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Darkthrone/A+Blaze+in+the+Northern+Sky\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
